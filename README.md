# 1. Micro and Array update
 Micro and Array Update Micro purchased an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got bored of it and
 decided to update value of its element. In one second he can increase value of each array element by 1. He wants each array element's
 value to become greater than or equal to K. Please help Micro to find out the minimum amount of time it will take, for him to do so. 
 
<h2> Input</h2>
First line consists of a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case consists of two 
space separated integers denoting N and K. Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A. 
 
<h2>Output</h2>
For each test case, print the minimum time in which all array elements will become greater than or equal to K. Print a new 
line after each test case. 

<h2>Constraints</h2>

1<=T<=5

1<=T<=10^5

1<=A[i]

k<=10^6

# 2. Hamiltonian and Lagrangian  
 Students have become secret admirers of SEGP. They find the course exciting and the professors amusing. After a superb Mid Semester  examination, itâ€™s now time for the results. The TAs have released the marks of students in the form of an array, where arr[i] represents  the marks of the ith student. 
 
 Since you are a curious kid, you want to find all the marks that are not smaller than those on its right side in the array. 
 
<h2>Input Format</h2>
The first line of input will contain a single integer n denoting the number of students. The next line will contain n space separated integers representing the marks of students. 
 
<h2>Output Format</h2>
 Output all the integers separated in the array from left to right that are not smaller than those on its right side. 
 
<h2>Constraints</h2> 

1 <= n <= 1000000 

0 <= arr[i] <= 10000

# 3. Frustrated coders   
 There are N frustrated coders standing in a circle with a gun in their hands. Each coder has a skill value S[ i ] and he can only kill  those coders that have strictly less skill than him. One more thing, all the guns have only 1 bullet. This roulette can take place in  any random order. Fortunately, you have the time stone (haaan wo harre wala) and you can see all possible outcomes of this scenario.  Find the outcome where the total sum of the remaining coder's skill is minimum. Print this sum. 
 
<h2>Input Format</h2>
 The first line contains N the no. of coders The next line contains N  elements where the ith element is theS[ i ] of ith coder. 
 
<h2>Output Format</h2>
 Print a single line containing the minimum sum. 
 
<h2>Constraints </h2>

1<= N <= 1000000 

1<=S[ i ]<=1000

# 4. Pink Floyd and Happiness 
 Pink is sad because of some reasons, he wants to cheer up by listening to some songs from his favorite band, Pink Floyd. 
 
There are N records and Pink will be happy if he listens to them in the ascending order, i.e., first the song No. 1, then No.2 and so on (He has to listen to all the N songs to become Happy). 
 
Pink is delivered his records in some given order, he can either add the record to the Playlist in the delivered order or put some on another table. After being put on the table only the topmost record can be added to the playlist at any time. 
 
Print whether Pink will be sad or happy after the delivery of the records. 
 
<h2> Input Format</h2>
N - Number of records followed  by N numbers- order of records. 
 
<h2>Output Format</h2> 
 Print "Happy" if the playlist has songs from 1 to N in order else "Sad".

# 5. Hacker and traffic lights
 Zolo is stuck in a traffic due to dysfunctional traffic light. Zolo is a professional hacker and he can get into the system and change  the state of the light. His planet has different types of traffic lights such that there are N bulbs on the traffic board and only when  all of them are green(G) the cars can pass. there are 2 other states also which the bulb can show; i.e. Red(R) & Yellow(Y). Note that  the lights are designed such that they follow a state change cyclic pattern as follows: 
 
                                   R------>Y----->G----->Y
                       
 Once Zolo gets into the system he can select any position i and update all elements between i to min(N, i + K - 1)  by increasing their  state by 1.This whole process takes 1 sec and he can repeat this process any no. of times until he gets all lights = G . Find the  minimum time to do the process as Zolo is getting late for work. 
 
<h2> Input Format </h2>
 The first line contains N K The second line describes the current status of each bulb as an array whose each element can either be G or  Y or R. 
 
<h2> Output Format</h2>
 Print the minimum amount of time required to clear the traffic jam". 
 
<h2> Constraints</h2> 

1<=N 

K<=100000.

# Haunted


The king of ghosts is really disappointed when he sees that all the human beings on Planet Earth have stopped fearing the ghost race. He knows the reason for this. The existing ghost race has become really lazy and has stopped visiting Planet Earth to scare the human race. Hence, he decides to encourage the entire ghost race into scaring the humans by holding a competition. The king, however, never visits Planet Earth.

This competition will go on for N days. Currently, there are a total of M ghosts (apart from the king) existing in the ghost race such that : - The youngest ghost is 1 year old. - The oldest ghost is M years old. - No two ghosts have the same age. - The age of each and every ghost is a positive integer.

On each day of the competition, ghosts have to visit Planet Earth to scare people. At the end of each day, a "Ghost of the Day" title is awarded to the ghost who scares the most number of humans on that particular day. However, the king of ghosts believes in consistency. Once this title has been given, the ghost who has won the most number of such titles until that particular moment is presented with a "Consistency Trophy". If there are many such ghosts, the oldest among them is given the trophy. Note that this "Title Giving" and "Trophy Giving" happens at the end of each day of the competition.

You will be given the age of the ghost who won the "Ghost of the Day" title on each day of the competition. Your job is to find out the age of the ghost who was awarded with the "Consistency Trophy" on each day of the competition.

Input Format The first line consists of 2 space separated integers N and M. The next line consists of N space separated integers such that the ith integer denotes the age of the ghost who was awarded with the "Ghost of the Day" title on the ith day of the competition.

Output Format Print N lines. The ith line should contain 2 space separated integers such that the first integer denotes the age of the ghost who was awarded with the "Consistency Trophy"

on the ith day and the second integer denotes the number of "Ghost of the Day" titles won by this ghost until the end of the ith day of the competition.

# Largest cycle in a tree

You are given a tree of N nodes and N-1 edges. Now you need to select two nodes a and b in the tree such that the cycle that will be formed after adding an edge between the two nodes a and b, its length should be maximum. If there are more than one possible answer, you can output any of them. 
<h2>Input Format</h2>
The first line contains an integer as N input. Next N-1 lines contain a pair of integers (a, b) that denote there is an edge between the two nodes a and b in the tree. 
<h2>Output Format</h2>
In the output, you need to print two integers separated by space which denote the nodes between which you can add the edge so as to maximize the length of the cycle in the tree.
